# DeploymentFactory Project

## Description
This project features a single factory contract, `DeploymentFactory`, designed to deploy smart contracts across multiple Superchains in a gas-efficient manner. By paying gas fees on just one Superchain, the contract leverages the Optimism L2-to-L2 Cross-Domain Messenger to deploy a specified smart contract on all targeted Superchains simultaneously. This approach simplifies multi-chain deployment, ensuring deterministic contract addresses via CREATE2 and reducing operational overhead by centralizing gas costs.

Key features:
- **Multi-Chain Deployment**: Deploys contracts on multiple Superchains with a single transaction.
- **Gas Efficiency**: Gas fees are paid only on the initiating Superchain.
- **Deterministic Addresses**: Uses CREATE2 with a salt for consistent contract addresses across chains.

The project includes deployment scripts and a comprehensive test suite to verify functionality.

## Setup Steps for Testing Deployment Scripts

To test the deployment and test deployment scripts, follow these steps. This assumes youâ€™re using Supersim (a simulation environment for Optimism Superchains) and Foundry for development.

### Prerequisites
- **Foundry**: Install Foundry by following the [official instructions](https://book.getfoundry.sh/getting-started/installation).
- **Supersim**: Clone and install Supersim from its repository (e.g., `git clone https://github.com/ethereum-optimism/supersim` and follow its setup guide).
- **Dependencies**: Ensure project dependencies (e.g., `optimism-contracts`, `forge-std`) are installed via `forge install`.

### Steps
1. **Start Supersim with Auto-Relay**:
   - In one terminal, navigate to your Supersim directory and start it with the auto-relay feature to simulate multiple Superchains (e.g., chain IDs 901 and 902):
     ```bash
     supersim --interop.autorelay
     ```
   - This sets up local RPC endpoints like `http://127.0.0.1:9545` (chain 901) and `http://127.0.0.1:9546` (chain 902).

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   - In a second terminal, navigate to your project directory and install all required packages:
     ```bash
     forge install
     ```

3. **Run the Deployment Script**:
   - Execute the deployment script `DeployFactory.s.sol` to deploy the `DeploymentFactory` contract on chain 901 with broadcasting enabled:
     ```bash
     forge script script/DeployFactory.s.sol --broadcast
     ```
   - Add `<PRIVATE_KEY>` with a valid private key in .env file in root directory.
   - After execution, note the deployed `DeploymentFactory` address printed in the console (e.g., `0x1234...`).

4. **Update and Run the Test Deployment Script**:
   - Open `script/TestDeploy.s.sol` in your project.
   - Paste the factory address from Step 3 into the script where indicated (e.g., replace a placeholder like `address factoryAddress = 0x...;` with your address).
   - Run the test deployment script to deploy a `TestToken` contract via the factory:
     ```bash
     forge script script/TestDeploy.s.sol --broadcast
     ```
   - This script uses the deployed factory to deploy `TestToken` on chain 901 and sends a cross-chain message to chain 902.

## Running the Test Script

To run the unit tests for the `DeploymentFactory` contract, use the following command:

```bash
forge test --match-path test/DeploymentFactoryTest.t.sol
